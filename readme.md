# Salty Stats

This project intends to keep track of fights on SaltyBet and track win ratios for the fighters.

This is really a way of me learning how node/expressjs/socket.io/jade interact. Consider it something of a basics playground. As such I'll be including links to basic resources and tools.

## Tools used

I used VSCode as an editor, and DBeaver as a convenient way of watching/editting the sqlite db. Most development was done on linux due to convenience, but nothing I used trapped me there. You should be able to do the same on any platform.
